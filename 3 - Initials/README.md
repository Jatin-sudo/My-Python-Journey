# 🆔 Initials - Block Letter Program

This Python program displays your initials using **block letters** made out of characters!

## 💬 Comments in Python

Comments are important for:

- Explaining what your code does
- Making it easier to read and maintain
- Temporarily disabling code

In Python, you can add a comment with the `#` symbol:

```python
# This is a comment
print("Hello!")  # This prints a message
```

---

## 🎯 Project Instructions

Create a program named `initials.py` that:

1. Begins with a comment that shares a fun fact about yourself.
2. Prints your **initials** using block letters made of characters.

### Example:

If your name is **Dua Lipa**, your initials would be `D` and `L`. Your output should look like:

```
DDDD   L
D   D  L
D   D  L
D   D  L
D   D  L
DDDD   LLLLL
```

## ✅ Tips

- Use `print()` multiple times to create the block shapes
- Think of each letter as a grid made of characters
- Customize it with your own initials!

## 📝 Example Starter Code

```python
# I love solving puzzles and playing chess in my free time!

print("JJJJJ  GGGG")
print("  J   G    ")
print("  J   G  GG")
print("J J   G   G")
print(" JJ    GGG ")
```

Happy Coding! 🚀
