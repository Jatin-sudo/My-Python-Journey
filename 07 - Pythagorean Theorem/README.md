# 07. Pythagorean Theorem 🧮

This Python project demonstrates how to take **user input**, convert it into integers, and apply the **Pythagorean Theorem** to calculate the hypotenuse of a right triangle.

## 📚 What You'll Learn
- Using the `input()` function to get user input
- Converting input to integers using `int()`
- Applying basic math formulas in Python
- Outputting results with `print()`

## 🧠 Concept

The **Pythagorean Theorem** relates the three sides of a right-angled triangle:

\[
c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
\]

Where:
- `a` is one side of the triangle
- `b` is the other side
- `c` is the hypotenuse (the longest side)

---

## 💡 How it Works

1. The program asks the user to input two numbers: side `a` and side `b`.
2. It converts these inputs to integers using `int()`.
3. It applies the Pythagorean Theorem to calculate the hypotenuse.
4. Finally, it prints out the value of `c`.
