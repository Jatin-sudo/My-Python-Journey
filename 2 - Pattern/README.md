# 📐 Pattern Challenge – Line by Line (03)

Welcome to the **Line by Line Pattern Challenge!**  
This project is part of a beginner-friendly Python series focused on understanding how Python runs line by line and how to structure outputs cleanly.

---

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

- How Python runs code from top to bottom.
- How to use multiple `print()` statements effectively.
- How to build number patterns with proper formatting.
- Practicing control over layout and indentation.

---

## 🔧 Instructions

You need to create a file named **`pattern.py`** that prints the exact pattern shown below:

```
        1
      2 3
    4 5 6
  7 8 9 10
```

### ✅ Your task:
Recreate this pattern **exactly** as displayed using only Python’s `print()` function.

> Tip: Pay close attention to spaces and line alignment!
