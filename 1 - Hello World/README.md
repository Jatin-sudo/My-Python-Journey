# 🖨️ Print in Python

In Python, the `print()` function is used to tell a computer to "talk."  
This is something we use *a lot*.

👋

The message we want to display should be inside the parentheses and surrounded by quotes.  
They can be double quotes `" "` or single quotes `' '`, but the opening and closing quote marks have to be the same.


### Example of a `print()` function:

```python
print('👋 Howdy')
```

In the example above, we instructed our program to print a message.  
This resulting text that is printed to the screen is referred to as the **output**.

**Output:**
```
👋 Howdy
```
