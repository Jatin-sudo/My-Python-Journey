## 📝 Instructions

We just got home from a fun trip to South America — specifically:
- 🇨🇴 **Colombia**
- 🇵🇪 **Peru**
- 🇧🇷 **Brazil**

There's some leftover cash in:
- Colombian **pesos**
- Peruvian **soles**
- Brazilian **reais**

Your task is to create a Python file `currency.py` that:

1. Asks the user how much they have in **pesos**, **soles**, and **reais**.
2. Converts each to USD using the current exchange rates.
3. Calculates and prints the total in **USD**.

---

*Note: Exchange rates change daily, so always check online before coding.*
